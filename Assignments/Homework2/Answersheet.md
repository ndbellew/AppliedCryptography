## Problem 1 Dice

### A

Entropy information is calculated by finding the entropy for each event and adding all of those numbers up. This was calculated by finding the Entropy of one die and then adding that 4 times for 4 events. 

- For One event: **2.585**

- For Four Events: **10.340**

### B

Following the logic in Part A, I created a list of four values, three of which are 1/6 and the last value is 3/6. This is because 3 of the 6 sides are now 5s meaning there is a 50% chance or 3/6 chance of rolling a five. 

- For One Event: **1.792**

- For Four Events: **8.962**
